This includes the transactions mandated under HIPAA.\nA taxonomy code is a unique alphanumeric code, ten characters in length.\nThe code set is structured into 3 distinct levels:\n\nProvider Grouping\nClassification\nArea of Specialization\n\nA taxonomy code describes a health care service provider’s type, classification, and the area of specialization. The primary specialty for this provider is indicated as (Primary) below.\nThe taxonomy codes are selected by the provider at the time of NPI registration. Selection of a taxonomy code does not replace any credentialing or validation process that the provider requesting the code should complete.\nHierarchy\n\n\n\n\nflowchart LR\n  A{{Group}} -.- D(Multi-Specialty)\n  A{{Group}} -.- E(Single-Specialty)\n  B{{Individual}} --&gt; F(Allopathic)\n  B{{Individual}} -.- G(Behavioral)\n  C{{Non-Individual}} -.- H(Hospitals)\n  C{{Non-Individual}} -.- I(Laboratories)\n  F(Allopathic) --&gt; J([Anesthesiology])\n  J([Anesthesiology]) --o K[[207L00000X]]\n  J([Anesthesiology]) --&gt; L&gt;Addiction Medicine]\n  L&gt;Addiction Medicine] --o M[[207LA0401X]]\n\n\nExample of Taxonomy Hierarchy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLevel I: Provider Grouping\n\n\n\nA major grouping of service(s) or occupation(s) of health care providers.\nExamples: - Allopathic & Osteopathic Physicians - Dental Providers - Hospitals\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLevel II: Classification\n\n\n\nA more specific service or occupation related to the Provider Grouping.\nFor example, the Classification for Allopathic & Osteopathic Physicians is based upon the General Specialty Certificates as issued by the appropriate national boards.\nThe following boards will however, have their general certificates appear as Level III Areas strictly due to display limitations of the code set for Boards that have multiple general certificates:\n\nMedical Genetics\nPreventive Medicine\nPsychiatry & Neurology\nRadiology\nSurgery\nOtolaryngology\nPathology\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLevel III: Area of Specialization\n\n\n\nA more specialized area of the Classification in which a provider chooses to practice or make services available.\nFor example, the Area of Specialization for provider grouping Allopathic & Osteopathic Physicians is based upon the Subspecialty Certificates as issued by the appropriate national boards.\n\n\n\n\n\n# A tibble: 874 × 10\n   code   display_name section grouping classification specialization definition\n   &lt;chr&gt;  &lt;chr&gt;        &lt;chr&gt;   &lt;chr&gt;    &lt;chr&gt;          &lt;chr&gt;          &lt;chr&gt;     \n 1 19320… Multi-Speci… Indivi… Group    Multi-Special… &lt;NA&gt;           A busines…\n 2 19340… Single Spec… Indivi… Group    Single Specia… &lt;NA&gt;           A busines…\n 3 207K0… Allergy & I… Indivi… Allopat… Allergy & Imm… &lt;NA&gt;           An allerg…\n 4 207KA… Allergy Phy… Indivi… Allopat… Allergy & Imm… Allergy        A physici…\n 5 207KI… Clinical & … Indivi… Allopat… Allergy & Imm… Clinical & La… An allerg…\n 6 207L0… Anesthesiol… Indivi… Allopat… Anesthesiology &lt;NA&gt;           An anesth…\n 7 207LA… Addiction M… Indivi… Allopat… Anesthesiology Addiction Med… An anesth…\n 8 207LC… Critical Ca… Indivi… Allopat… Anesthesiology Critical Care… An anesth…\n 9 207LH… Hospice and… Indivi… Allopat… Anesthesiology Hospice and P… An anesth…\n10 207LP… Pain Medici… Indivi… Allopat… Anesthesiology Pain Medicine  An anesth…\n# ℹ 864 more rows\n# ℹ 3 more variables: notes &lt;chr&gt;, version &lt;chr&gt;, release_date &lt;date&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngrouping\nclassification\nspecialization\ncode\ndefinition\n\n\n\n1\nGroup\nMulti-Specialty\nNA\n193200000X\nA business group of one or more individual practitioners, who practice with different areas of specialization.\n\n\n2\nGroup\nSingle Specialty\nNA\n193400000X\nA business group of one or more individual practitioners, all of who practice with the same area of specialization.\n\n\n3\nAllopathic & Osteopathic Physicians\nAllergy & Immunology\nNA\n207K00000X\nAn allergist-immunologist is trained in evaluation, physical and laboratory diagnosis, and management of disorders involving the immune system.

    "text": "Limiting Charge\nOne possible option for non-participating providers is to choose to accept assignment for some services but to decline assignment for others. For services that they accept assignment for, they are only able to bill the Medicare-approved amount. However, for other services, they are allowed to charge up to 15 percent more than the Medicare-approved amount.\nThis limit cap is known as the limiting charge. Providers that do not fully participate only receive 95 percent of the Medicare-approved amount when Medicare reimburses them for the cost of care. In turn, the provider can charge the patient up to 15 percent more than this reimbursement amount. This extra charge will not be covered by Medicare, which causes Medicare recipients to incur greater out-of-pocket costs.\nThe Medicare limiting charge is the maximum amount a Non-Participating Provider can charge for services submitted on a non-assigned claim. This is that maximum amount a beneficiary could legally be charged.\nCalculation\nThe Medicare limiting charge is, by law, set at \\(115\\%\\) of the payment amount for the service furnished by the Non-Participating Physician.\nHowever, the law sets the payment amount for Non-Participating Physicians at \\(95\\%\\) of the payment amount for Participating Physicians (i.e., the Fee Schedule amount).\nCalculating \\(95\\%\\) of \\(115\\%\\) of an amount, \\(x\\), is equivalent to \\(x \\times 1.0925\\) (or \\(109.25\\%\\)):\n\n# 95% of 115% of 10\n(10 * 1.15) * 0.95 \n\n#&gt; [1] 10.925\n\n# 109.25% of 10\n10 * 1.0925 \n\n#&gt; [1] 10.925\n\n# using the northstar package\nlimiting_charge(10)\n\n#&gt; [1] 10.925"

When the physician or other qualified health care professional component is reported separately, the service may be identified by adding modifier 26 to the usual procedure number.\n\n\nTC\n1076\nTechnical Component\nUnder certain circumstances, a charge may be made for the technical component alone. Under those circumstances the technical component charge is identified by adding modifier TC to the usual procedure number. Technical component charges are institutional charges and not billed separately by physicians; however, portable x-ray suppliers only bill for technical component and should utilize modifier TC. The charge data from portable x-ray suppliers will then be used to build customary and prevailing profiles.\n\n\n531\n\n4\nDiscontinued Procedure\nUnder certain circumstances, the physician or other qualified health care professional may elect to terminate a surgical or diagnostic procedure. Due to extenuating circumstances or those that threaten the well being of the patient, it may be necessary to indicate that a surgical or diagnostic procedure was started but discontinued. This circumstance may be reported by adding modifier 53 to the code reported by the individual for the discontinued procedure.\n\n\n\n\nFor services other than those with a professional and/or technical component, a blank will appear in this field with one exception: the presence of CPT modifier 53 indicates that separate RVUs and a fee schedule amount have been established for procedures which the physician terminated before completion. This modifier is used only with colonoscopy CPT codes 44388 and 45378, or with G0105 and G0121. Any other codes billed with modifier 53 are subject to carrier medical review and priced by individual consideration.\n\n\n\n1 Not used to report the elective cancellation of a procedure prior to the patient's anesthesia induction and/or surgical preparation in the operating suite. For outpatient hospital/ambulatory surgery center (ASC) reporting of a previously scheduled procedure/service that is partially reduced or cancelled as a result of extenuating circumstances or those that threaten the well being of the patient prior to or after administration of anesthesia, see modifiers 73 and 74 (see modifiers approved for ASC hospital outpatient use)."

    "text": "Status Codes\nIndicates whether the code is in the fee schedule and whether it is separately payable if the service is covered. See Attachment A for description of values.\nOnly RVUs associated with status codes of A, R, or T, are used for Medicare payment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# of Codes\nname\ndescription\n\n\n\nA\n8,975\nActive Code\nThese codes are separately paid under the Physician Fee Schedule if covered. There will be RVUs and payment amounts for codes with this status. The presence of an A indicator does not mean that Medicare has made a National Coverage Determination regarding the service. Carriers remain responsible for coverage decisions in the absence of a national Medicare policy.\n\n\nX\n2,527\nStatutory Exclusion\nThese codes represent an item or service that is not in the statutory definition of “physician services” for fee schedule payment purposes. No RVUs or payment amounts are shown for these codes and no payment may be made under the physician fee schedule. Ex: Ambulance services and Clinical Diagnostic Laboratory Services.\n\n\nI\n1,411\nNot Valid for Medicare Purposes\nMedicare uses another code for reporting of, and payment for, these services. (Code NOT subject to a 90 day grace period.)\n\n\nE\n1,343\nRegulatory Exclusion\nThese codes are for items and/or services that CMS chose to exclude from the fee schedule payment by regulation. No RVUs or payment amounts are shown and no payment may be made under the fee schedule for these codes. Payment for them, when covered, continues under reasonable charge procedures.\n\n\nM\n1,201\nMeasurement Code\nUsed for reporting purposes only.\n\n\nC\n1,156\nCarrier Priced\nCarriers will establish RVUs and payment amounts for these services, generally on an individual case basis following review of documentation such as an operative report.\n\n\nR\n1,050\nRestricted Coverage\nSpecial coverage instructions apply.\n\n\nN\n327\nNon-Covered Service\nThese codes are carried on the HCPCS tape as noncovered services.\n\n\nJ\n276\nAnesthesia Service\nNo relative Status units or payment amounts for anesthesia codes on the database, only used to facilitate the identification of anesthesia services.\n\n\nP\n142\nBundled/Excluded Code\nThere are no RVUs and no payment amounts for these services. No separate payment is made for them under the fee schedule. If the item or service is covered as incident to a physician service and is provided on the same day as a physician service, payment for it is bundled into the payment for the physician service to which it is incident (an example is an elastic bandage furnished by a physician incident to a physician service). If the item or service is covered as other than incident to a physician service, it is excluded from the fee schedule (for example, colostomy supplies) and is paid under the other payment provision of the Act.\n\n\nB\n83\nPayment Bundled\nPayment for covered services are always bundled into payment for other services not specified: There will be no RVUs or payment amounts for these codes and no separate payment is ever made. When these services are covered, payment for them is subsumed by the payment for the services to which they are incident (an example is a telephone call from a hospital nurse regarding care of a patient).\n\n\nT\n8\nNo Other Services Payable\nThere are RVUs and payment amounts for these services, but they are only paid if there are no other services payable under the physician fee schedule billed on the same date by the same provider. If any other services payable under the physician fee schedule are billed on the same date by the same provider, these services are bundled into the physician services for which payment is made."

This applies to CPT codes 88141, 85060 and HCPCS code P3001-26. No TC billing is recognized because payment for the underlying clinical laboratory test is made to the hospital, generally through the PPS rate. No payment is recognized for CPT codes 88141, 85060 or HCPCS code P3001-26 furnished to hospital outpatients or non-hospital patients. The physician interpretation is paid through the clinical laboratory fee schedule payment for the clinical laboratory test.\n\n\n9\n7,704\nNot Applicable\nConcept of a professional/technical component does not apply."
