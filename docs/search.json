    "text": "Limiting Charge\nOne possible option for non-participating providers is to choose to accept assignment for some services but to decline assignment for others. For services that they accept assignment for, they are only able to bill the Medicare-approved amount. However, for other services, they are allowed to charge up to 15 percent more than the Medicare-approved amount.\nThis limit cap is known as the limiting charge. Providers that do not fully participate only receive 95 percent of the Medicare-approved amount when Medicare reimburses them for the cost of care. In turn, the provider can charge the patient up to 15 percent more than this reimbursement amount. This extra charge will not be covered by Medicare, which causes Medicare recipients to incur greater out-of-pocket costs.\nThe Medicare limiting charge is the maximum amount a Non-Participating Provider can charge for services submitted on a non-assigned claim. This is that maximum amount a beneficiary could legally be charged.\nLimiting Charge Calculation\nThe Medicare limiting charge is, by law, set at \\(115\\%\\) of the payment amount for the service furnished by the Non-Participating Physician.\nHowever, the law sets the payment amount for Non-Participating Physicians at \\(95\\%\\) of the payment amount for Participating Physicians (i.e., the Fee Schedule amount).\nCalculating \\(95\\%\\) of \\(115\\%\\) of an amount, \\(x\\), is equivalent to \\(x \\times 1.0925\\) (or \\(109.25\\%\\)):\n\n# 95% of 115% of 10\n(10 * 1.15) * 0.95 \n\n#&gt; [1] 10.925\n\n# 109.25% of 10\n10 * 1.0925 \n\n#&gt; [1] 10.925\n\n\nTherefore, to calculate the Medicare limiting charge for a physician service for a locality, multiply the fee schedule amount (participating fee) by a factor of 1.0925. The result is the Medicare limiting charge for that service for that locality to which the fee schedule amount applies.\n\nlimiting_charge &lt;- function(x) {\n  stopifnot(\"x must be numeric\" = is.numeric(x))\n  x * 1.0925\n}\n\nlimiting_charge(26.35)\n\n#&gt; [1] 28.78738"

Due to extenuating circumstances or those that threaten the well being of the patient, it may be necessary to indicate that a surgical or diagnostic procedure was started but discontinued. This circumstance may be reported by adding modifier 53 to the code reported by the individual for the discontinued procedure.\n\n\n\n\nFor services other than those with a professional and/or technical component, a blank will appear in this field with one exception: the presence of CPT modifier 53 indicates that separate RVUs and a fee schedule amount have been established for procedures which the physician terminated before completion.
