<p>The <strong>Health Care Provider Taxonomy Code Set</strong> is an external, non-medical data code set designed for use in an electronic environment, specifically within the <em>ASC X12N</em> Health Care transactions. This includes the transactions mandated under HIPAA.</p>
<p>A taxonomy code is a unique alphanumeric code, ten characters in length.</p>
<p>The code set is structured into 3 distinct levels:</p>
<ul>
<li>Provider Grouping</li>
<li>Classification</li>
<li>Area of Specialization</li>
</ul>
<p>A taxonomy code describes a health care service provider’s type, classification, and the area of specialization. The primary specialty for this provider is indicated as (Primary) below.</p>
<p>The taxonomy codes are selected by the provider at the time of NPI registration. Selection of a taxonomy code does not replace any credentialing or validation process that the provider requesting the code should complete.</p>

Level II: Classification

</div>
<div class="callout-body-container callout-body">
<p>A more specific service or occupation related to the Provider Grouping.</p>
<p>For example, the Classification for Allopathic &amp; Osteopathic Physicians is based upon the General Specialty Certificates as issued by the appropriate national boards.</p>
<p>The following boards will however, have their general certificates appear as Level III Areas strictly due to display limitations of the code set for Boards that have multiple general certificates:</p>
<ul>
<li>Medical Genetics</li>
<li>Preventive Medicine</li>
<li>Psychiatry &amp; Neurology</li>
<li>Radiology</li>
<li>Surgery</li>

Level III: Area of Specialization
</div>
</div>
<div class="callout-body-container callout-body">
<p>A more specialized area of the Classification in which a provider chooses to practice or make services available.</p>
<p>For example, the Area of Specialization for provider grouping Allopathic &amp; Osteopathic Physicians is based upon the Subspecialty Certificates as issued by the appropriate national boards.</p>
