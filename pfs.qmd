# Overview

This file contains information on services covered by the Medicare Physician Fee Schedule (MPFS) in 2024. For more than 10,000 physician services, the file contains the associated relative value units (RVUs), a fee schedule status indicator, and various payment policy indicators needed for payment adjustment (i.e., payment of assistant at surgery, team surgery, bilateral surgery, etc.).

The Medicare physician fee schedule amounts are adjusted to reflect the variation in practice costs from area to area. A geographic practice cost index (GPCI) has been established for every Medicare payment locality for each of the three components of a procedure’s relative value unit (i.e., the RVUs for work, practice expense, and malpractice). The GPCIs are applied in the calculation of a fee schedule payment amount by multiplying the RVU for each component times the GPCI for that component.

## Payment Formulas

|          |                                                   |
|----------|---------------------------------------------------|
| $RVU_w$  | *Work* Relative Value Unit                        |
| $GPCI_w$ | *Work* Geographic Practice Cost Index             |
| $RVU_p$  | *Practice Expense* Relative Value Unit            |
| $GPCI_p$ | *Practice Expense* Geographic Practice Cost Index |
| $RVU_m$  | *Malpractice* Relative Value Unit                 |
| $GPCI_m$ | *Malpractice* Geographic Practice Cost Index      |
| $CF$     | Conversion Factor                                 |

<br>

The formulas for 2024 Physician Fee Schedule payment amounts are as follows:

::: panel-tabset
## Participating

$$ x = [(RVU_w \times GPCI_w) + (RVU_p \times GPCI_p) + (RVU_m \times GPCI_m)] \times CF $$

## Non-Participating

$$ y = 0.95x $$

## Limiting Charge

$$ z = 0.95(1.15x) $$
:::

As there is a corresponding GPCI value for each of the three components of an RVU, the formula is essentially the [dot product](https://www.toppr.com/guides/maths-formulas/dot-product-formula/) of the RVU and GPCI vectors, multiplied by the conversion factor:

$$ a \cdot b = a_1b_1 + a_2b_2 + a_3b_3$$

$$
  f(y;a,b) = \begin{cases}
    \frac{1}{b-a} & \text{if } a \leq y \leq b, \\
    0 & \text{otherwise}.
  \end{cases}
$$

```{r}
wrvu  = 6.26   # Work RVU
wgpci = 1      # Work GPCI

pgpci = 0.883  # Practice GPCI
prvu  = 4.36   # Practice RVU

mrvu  = 0.99   # Malpractice RVU
mgpci = 1.125  # Malpractice GPCI

cf    = 32.744 # Conversion Factor
```

```{r}

### Non-Facility vs. Facility

Under the Medicare Physician Fee schedule (MPFS), some procedures have separate rates for physicians’ services when provided in facility and non-facility settings.

The rate, facility or non-facility, which a physician service is paid under the MPFS is determined by the Place of Service (POS) code that is used to identify the setting where the patient received the face-to-face encounter with the physician, non-physician practitioner (NPP) or other supplier.

In general, the POS code reflects the actual place where the patient receives the face-to-face service and determines whether the facility or non-facility payment rate is paid.

Services rendered to a patient who is an inpatient of a hospital (POS code 21) or an outpatient of a hospital (POS codes 19 or 22), the facility rate is paid, regardless of where the face-to-face encounter with the patient occurred.

### Therapy Code Caps

Certain therapy codes will receive a 50% reduction to the PE.

Section 5102(b) of the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 requires a payment cap on the *Technical Component (TC)* of certain diagnostic imaging procedures and the TC portions of the global diagnostic imaging services.

This cap is based on the *Outpatient Prospective Payment System (OPPS)* payment. To implement this provision, the physician fee schedule amount is compared to the OPPS payment amount and **the lower amount is used in the formula above to calculate payment.**

# Accepting Assignment

Accepting assignment means that a healthcare provider or facility is partnered with Medicare and is required by law to charge only the Medicare-approved amount for various services. This amount is preset by Medicare and is often less than many healthcare facilities would charge.

Because of this, when patients receive care at a facility that accepts assignment, they will be required to pay lower out-of-pocket costs as Medicare will cover the full amount of the service cost. Personal costs only include the premium and any charges up to the deductible amount.

Physicians or facilities that do not accept assignment are a <b>non-participating providers</b>. All physicians are required to file with Medicare, indicating that they either accept or do not accept assignment. If a provider does not accept assignment, it means that they are not required to charge only the Medicare-approved amount for services.

## Limiting Charge

One possible option for non-participating providers is to choose to accept assignment for some services but to decline assignment for others. For services that they accept assignment for, they are only able to bill the Medicare-approved amount. However, for other services, they are allowed to charge up to 15 percent more than the Medicare-approved amount.

This limit cap is known as the limiting charge. Providers that do not fully participate only receive 95 percent of the Medicare-approved amount when Medicare reimburses them for the cost of care. In turn, the provider can charge the patient up to 15 percent more than this reimbursement amount. This extra charge will not be covered by Medicare, which causes Medicare recipients to incur greater out-of-pocket costs.

The Medicare limiting charge is the maximum amount a Non-Participating Provider can charge for services submitted on a non-assigned claim. This is that maximum amount a beneficiary could legally be charged.

### Limiting Charge Calculation

The Medicare limiting charge is, by law, set at $115\%$ of the payment amount for the service furnished by the Non-Participating Physician.

However, the law sets the payment amount for Non-Participating Physicians at $95\%$ of the payment amount for Participating Physicians (i.e., the Fee Schedule amount).

Calculating $95\%$ of $115\%$ of an amount, $x$, is equivalent to $x \times 1.0925$ (or $109.25\%$):

```{r}
# 95% of 115% of 10
(10 * 1.15) * 0.95 

# 109.25% of 10
10 * 1.0925 
```

Therefore, to calculate the Medicare limiting charge for a physician service for a locality, multiply the fee schedule amount (participating fee) by a factor of 1.0925. The result is the Medicare limiting charge for that service for that locality to which the fee schedule amount applies.

```{r}
limiting_charge <- function(x) {
  stopifnot("x must be numeric" = is.numeric(x))
  x * 1.0925
}

limiting_charge(26.35)
```
